implemented NegateWounds and NegateTraumas into the importer
added a check when importing that if a particular row is empty (like MorphTraits:: with nothing else) it won't crash anymore

r290

Completed a first draft of the importer, will need extensive testing.
New Campaign macro: ClearAllSelectedTokenCache.  Simply clears the Cache of all selected tokens, useable by GM only.
Changed all instances of "Exotic Melee" and "Exotic Ranged" to include the word "Weapon" at the end now in macros.  Old bug that was never caught.
Added a MODIFICATIONS_LIBRARY and SKILL_LIBRARY to the zData properties.
Fixed some defaults in Player properties.
Updated PsiSleightsUse to get rid of Psi Efficiency and instead just use Siphon for the same.  Also made it look for Siphon 1/2/3 and remove the respective amount of strain.

Figured out regex error with Ego Trait imports and ended up recoding it to use json.ToList instead and doing more formatting in the excel sheet as it was easier

r288

almost finished with Ego Trait import but have an annoying regex error popping up asking for an assignment, might be related to getting no matches for a group and still trying to reference it
removed some defaults from the Player properties that weren't needed

r281

* removed listCleaner function, just moved the code to ImportChar2 instead
* Import should now only work on an impersonated token, and only if you are a GM
* ImportChar2 updated so that it parses and sets Name through Rep from the Import tab on the spreadsheet (not SPD yet, need to parse that differently)
