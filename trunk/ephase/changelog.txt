Figured out regex error with Ego Trait imports and ended up recoding it to use json.ToList instead and doing more formatting in the excel sheet as it was easier

r288

almost finished with Ego Trait import but have an annoying regex error popping up asking for an assignment, might be related to getting no matches for a group and still trying to reference it
removed some defaults from the Player properties that weren't needed

r287

r286

r284

added u-rep and x-rep to import and to player properties (still need to implement on sheet)

r281

* removed listCleaner function, just moved the code to ImportChar2 instead
* Import should now only work on an impersonated token, and only if you are a GM
* ImportChar2 updated so that it parses and sets Name through Rep from the Import tab on the spreadsheet (not SPD yet, need to parse that differently)

r280

* @Sheet updated to only refresh on Player or NonCombatPlayer token property types
* added NonCombatPlayer property type, just a copy of Player
* added zData property type, for Data lib token
* updated @ClearAllTokenCache to refresh Player and NonCombatPlayer tokens
* updated @AddAllToInitiative to only add Player token types to Init panel
* cleaned up all hard references to Lib:MnM and changed to +LibFunction instead
* finished ep_data spreadsheet, pasted all macros onto Lib:zData and populated it with all information
