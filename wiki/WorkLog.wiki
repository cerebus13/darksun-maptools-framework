= Introduction =

A simple journal detailing the coding work I've gotten done on a given day.

===04/07/2010===

  * Added Insubstantial to Campaign Props, and then implemented it inside DoAttack2.  Added comments for spots where I am going to deal with Resists/Vulns and even Swarms above Insubstantial...because it applies last.
  * Cleaned up a possible bug in DoAttack2.
  * Fixed DefineFunction calls for decodeVulnResistJson and applyVulnResistJson so they get a new variable scope.

  * Got the correct format for a nested Object/Array Json worked out and put into the wiki for the CallAttack macro comments.
  * Finally got Resists/Vulns to apply to target and self through a passed Json in a power.
  * With _application_ of Vulns/Resists worked out, now I need to work on getting DoAttack2 to respect them based on Keywords of power and Keywords of Resist/Vuln that are present.  Don't forget to handle Generic...
  * Had a Piercing (resist avoidance) property I wanted to implement for powers or as a property on a token, curious if I should bother with that now or just leave it on the wish list.
  * When working on DoAttack2 I should toss a property on tokens to indicate if they are Insubstantial and half damage.  Swarms also half damage from melee/ranged attacks, but have a variable Vuln to Area/Close so I'm not sure how to implement that quite yet.
